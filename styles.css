/* Step 8
Now that your external CSS file is set up, you can start styling the page.

As a reminder, here's how to target a paragraph element and align it to the right:

p {
  text-align: right;
}
Create a new CSS rule that targets the h1 element, and set its text-align property to center. */

h1 {
  text-align: center;
}

/* Step 11
It's time to add some color to the marker. Remember that one way to add color to an element is to use a color keyword like black, cyan, or yellow.

As a reminder, here's how to target the class freecodecamp:

.freecodecamp {
  
}
Create a new CSS rule that targets the class marker, and set its background-color property to red.

Note: You will not see any changes after adding the CSS. */

.marker {
  background-color: red;
}
