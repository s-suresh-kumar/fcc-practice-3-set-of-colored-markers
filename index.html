<!-- Step 1
As you've seen in the previous projects, webpages should start with a DOCTYPE html declaration, followed by an html element.

Add a DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document, and an html element after that. Give the html element a lang attribute with en as its value. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

  <!-- Step 2
  Nest a head element within the html element. Just after the head element, add a body element. -->

<head></head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>
