<!-- Step 1
As you've seen in the previous projects, webpages should start with a DOCTYPE html declaration, followed by an html element.

Add a DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document, and an html element after that. Give the html element a lang attribute with en as its value. -->
html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<!-- Step 2
  Nest a head element within the html element. Just after the head element, add a body element. -->

<head>

  <!-- Step 3
  Remember that the title element gives search engines extra information about the page. It also displays the content of that title element in two more ways:
  
  in the title bar when the page is open
  in the browser tab for the page when you hover on it. Even if that tab is not active, once you hover on the tab, the title text is displayed.
  Within the head element, nest a title element with the text Colored Markers. -->

  <title>Colored Markers</title>

  <!-- Step 4
To tell browsers how to encode characters on your page, set the charset to utf-8. utf-8 is a universal character set that includes almost every character from all human languages.

Inside the head element, nest a meta element with the attribute charset set to utf-8. Remember that meta elements are self-closing, and do not need a closing tag. -->

<meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- 
Step 5
You can have multiple self-closing meta elements on a web page. What distinguishes one meta element from the other is the attribute. You should add a new meta element for each attribute you want to specify.

Add another self-closing meta element within the head. Give it a name attribute set to viewport and a content attribute set to width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0 so your page looks the same on all devices. -->

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

</head>

<body>

</body>
