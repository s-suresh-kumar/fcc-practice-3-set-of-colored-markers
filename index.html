<!-- Step 1
As you've seen in the previous projects, webpages should start with a DOCTYPE html declaration, followed by an html element.

Add a DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document, and an html element after that. Give the html element a lang attribute with en as its value. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<!-- Step 2
  Nest a head element within the html element. Just after the head element, add a body element. -->

<head>

  <!-- Step 3
  Remember that the title element gives search engines extra information about the page. It also displays the content of that title element in two more ways:
  
  in the title bar when the page is open
  in the browser tab for the page when you hover on it. Even if that tab is not active, once you hover on the tab, the title text is displayed.
  Within the head element, nest a title element with the text Colored Markers. -->

  <title>Colored Markers</title>

  <!-- Step 4
To tell browsers how to encode characters on your page, set the charset to utf-8. utf-8 is a universal character set that includes almost every character from all human languages.

Inside the head element, nest a meta element with the attribute charset set to utf-8. Remember that meta elements are self-closing, and do not need a closing tag. -->

<meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- 
Step 5
You can have multiple self-closing meta elements on a web page. What distinguishes one meta element from the other is the attribute. You should add a new meta element for each attribute you want to specify.

Add another self-closing meta element within the head. Give it a name attribute set to viewport and a content attribute set to width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0 so your page looks the same on all devices. -->

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

<!-- Step 7
In this project you'll work with an external CSS file to style the page. We've already created a styles.css file for you. But before you can use it, you'll need to link it to the page.

Nest a link element within the head element. Give it a rel attribute set to stylesheet and an href attribute set to styles.css. -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

<body>
  <!-- Step 6
  Now you're ready to start adding content to the page.
  
  Within the body, nest an h1 element with the text CSS Color Markers. -->

  <h1>CSS Color Markers</h1>

  <!-- Step 9
  Now you'll add some elements that you'll eventually style into color markers.
  
  First, within the body element, add a div element and set its class attribute to container. Make sure the div element is below the h1 element. -->

<div class="container">

  <!-- Step 10
  Next, within the div element, add another div element and give it a class of marker. -->

  <!-- Step 16
  To give the markers different colors, you will need to add a unique class to each one. Multiple classes can be added to an element by listing them in the class attribute and separating them with a space. For example, the following adds both the animal and dog classes to a div element.
  
  <div class="animal dog">
  If you add multiple classes to an HTML element, the styles of the first classes you list may be overridden by later classes.
  
  To begin, add the class one to the first marker div element. -->

  <!-- Step 41
  Now it's time to add other details to the markers, starting with the first one.
  
  In the first marker div element, change the class one to red. -->

  <div class=" red marker"></div>

  <!-- Step 14
  Now that you've got one marker centered with color, it's time to add the other markers.
  
  In the container div, add two more div elements and give them each a class of marker. -->

  <!-- Step 19
  Add the class two to the second marker div, and add the class three to the third marker div. -->

  <div class="two marker"></div>
  <div class="three marker"></div>


</div>

</body>
